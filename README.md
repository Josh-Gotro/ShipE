2. Copy the [Sandbox](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) API key.
3 Paste into `server/.env` assigned to `API_Key`. It will look something like this:

*Note: you may use a trial account, which includes free credits, but you will be restricted to testing only from your personal phone number.*  
2. Rent a number following [these instructions](https://support.plivo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041397412-How-can-I-rent-a-phone-number-), ensuring to choose one that is SMS enabled. 
3. Create an application and assign a number to it following [these instructions](https://support.plivo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041395852-How-can-I-set-up-an-application-and-assign-a-number-to-it-).

3. Choose the Cloud Providor and Region of your preference. (I used AWS/N. Virginia)
